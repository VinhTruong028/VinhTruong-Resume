        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-businessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Vinh Truong and I am currently a first-year student at University of California, Riverside. As of right now, I am currently a Pre business major until I can switch to Business administration. I am currently a full-time student and unemployed, meaning I am not working for any company at the moment. However, I am a hardworking and responsible college student that is willing to contribute to the workforce using my thriving social skills, technical skills, and clear communication.<br><br>

       I am proficient in using Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I am also fluent in both English and Vietnamese. I have also studied the French language for three years. I consider myself to be quite tech savvy, knowing how to use technology fast and efficiently, as well as being well versed in the use of Microsoft office. I am currently learning how to code websites in my Intro to Computing class.<br><br>

       I have a lot of work experience through volunteering. For example, I have volunteered over three hundred hours at Fantasy Nail Salon, a small, local business with three stores all located in San Jose, California. I have also volunteered intermittently in different businesses, such as the nonprofit organization known as Christmas in the Park and at Evergreen Valley High School. <br><br>
        
       In terms of Leadership experience, I also have a good amount. Along with the volunteering experiences Iâ€™ve had, I have also been club officers in multiple clubs. I was the secretary of the athletics club at Evergreen Valley High School, which was in charge of planning and financing school sports events, and I was also the Public Relations of a small club called Project Fed Up. Project Fed Up is a club dedicated to spreading awareness about mental health and eating disorders with a focus on the latter. Aside from school, I have also been the secretary of a Mental Health Club in Cupertino, California where I spread awareness of mental health issues to Asian communities in Cupertino.<br><br>
        
        As of now, I cannot provide any type of college GPA, however I can assure that I am a good student with a great work ethic, as can be seen from my extensive list of leadership and work experience. I am a very dependable and reliable worker with strong job integrity. I will be able to work at most given times and am very cooperative. I always striving to do and be better for myself and others (working included!) through constantly learning and improving. Though I donâ€™t have too many jobs under my belt, I will certainly still be a good addition to any team and the right candidate for the job.<br><br>
